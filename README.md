Software and Data Citation Workshop
===================================

Use cases and products from the Software and Data Citation Workshop (https://softwaredatacitation.org/)

## Use Cases

This repository is mainly for use case development and discussion, and uses the standard GitHub issue tracker. You will need a GitHub account to be able to add use cases and discuss existing use cases.  For an example use case, see [Use Case #1](https://github.com/mbjones/software-data-citation-ws/issues/1).

### Adding a new use case

1. open the [Issues](https://github.com/mbjones/software-data-citation-ws/issues) section of this repository and click on New Issue.  
2. Provide  a short, descriptive title starting with "Use Case:"
3. Add the appropriate labels, including one of `citing data`, `citing software`, and `use case`

Please use the following Markdown template for new use cases to encourage some uniformity across the use cases. Copy and paste it into the body of your new issue, and then edit it to add your use case details before saving the issue to GitHub.

```markdown
# Use Case:

## Goals and Summary

## Additional Information and Links

```

### Discussing an existing use case
Please feel free to add relevant comments to the use cases, which might expand upon the case, point out similarities to other use cases, or suggest revisions to the description, among other things.  Use Case authors should incorporate revisions based on the comments as they see fit, and at the workshop we will further formalize these into a set that the group expects to reasonably represent science community needs for software and data citation.
